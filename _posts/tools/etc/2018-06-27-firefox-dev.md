I usally use chrome for developing browser.


But it's bit slow and heavy. So I try to use firefox and very satisfied.


And I found out there's firefox developer edition. 


You can download [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en/firefox/developer/)


It supports great console and debugger. Also, it's faster than chrome while debugging.


If you want to find out new browser for developing, try firefox dev edition.
