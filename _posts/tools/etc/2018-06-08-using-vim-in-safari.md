In chrome, I use `vimium`(https://github.com/philc/vimium) for using `vim` key in browser. It's really convinent when searching browser just with keyboard. 


But `vimium` is chrome extension so I can't use it in safari and other browser. (I use multiple browser - `chrome`, `safari`, `opera`, and `firefox`)


So I find other vim key extension for other browsers.


## In chrome

### `Vimium` (Recommend for chrome)

- only for chrome (chrome extension)
- Can download [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb)
- Well optimized, not much bug.
- Can add exclude website
- Not much custom configure


### `cVim`
- Chrome extension (chromium-vim)
- can suppoer `cVimrc` (vim configuration)


## In safari

### `Vimari`
- Safari version of vimium (Based on vimium)
- Same as vimium
- Scroll (`j`, `k`) is little bit unnatural


### `Svim` (Recommend for Safari)
- Only for safari (Safari extension)
- safari version of `cVim`


## In opera

There's no opera add-ons for vim keys, so can use `vimium` in opera installing `Install Chrome Extension` add-ons. With this, you can use chrome extension in opera. (Install in [here](https://addons.opera.com/ko/extensions/details/install-chrome-extensions/))


## In firefox

### `Vimium-FF` (Recommend for firefox)
- vimium for firefox version
- Most stuff works but the port to firefox remains a work in progress
- Can install [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/?src=search)


### `Vim vixen`
- An add-on which allows you to navigate with vim-like bindings.
- Can install [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vim-vixen/?src=search)
