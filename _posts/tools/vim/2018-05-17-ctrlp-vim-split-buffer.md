When using `ctrlp.vim` ([ctrlp github](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)), basically it opens the file in current buffer.

If you want to open in new buffer, can use 

```vim
<c-t>
<c-v>
<c-x>
```



### Other command

```vim
# cycle between modes (file, mru(Most Recently Used), buffer)
<c-f> or <c-b>

# switched to regexp
<c-r>

# navigate
<c-j> or <c-k>

# next/previous input string
<c-n> or <c-p>
```
