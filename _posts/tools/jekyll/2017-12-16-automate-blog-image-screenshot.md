Nowadays, I hooked on great application, Better Touch Tool. I'm using BTT for many functions - shortcuts for application, play/stop on current video on safari (such as udemy, youtube), open specific document... and so on!

And I find out that there's really great feature about screenshot in BTT. (Maybe I noticed it too late)


I currently use `jekyll` for writing my blog (because I prefer vim even while write blogs) and upload it to daum `tistory` blog. (for just distribution) 

So it's not that easy to upload images to my blog. I always make screen shot first, and add it to jekyll image directory, (which is too complicated), and upload it to github server.


Now I can easliy upload my image by single one click (or keyboard shortcuts!)


Better Touch Tool supply many screenshot features including upload to [ `imgur` ](https://imgur.com/). I make shortcut to upload to imgur and automatically copy the url. After copying url, I can use the url to my post's markdown img syntax! That's easy, right?

## Conclusion
### 1. Download [ `BTT` ](https://www.boastr.net/) (it's not free app now, but free tutorial for 45 days - and it cost only 5$. I highly recommend this application)


### 2. Make keyboard shortcuts for screenshots
- Anything you want is possible
- I use `Shift + Command + B`: it's simmilar to mac default screenshot command, and `B` means blog

- if you want to edit screen shot, choose frist one (captuer screenshot then edit in BTT) : BTT screenshot window automatically open after you take screenshot

- elif you just want to upload imgur, choose second one: nothing happen after screenshot, just upload screenshot and copy url to your clipboard! **Super Easy way**

### 3. Config screenshot setting
if you choose second one (configure), you have to config your own setting. (Don't afraid. It's super easy)

When popping up config window, click `After capture` and set to `Upload to imgur`;
